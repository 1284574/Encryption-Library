# Encryption-Library
Encryption Library in C. Uses the RC4 Cipher. RC4 Cipher - stream cipher and variable-length key algorithm. The algorithm encrypts one byte at a time. A key is a pseudorandom bit generator that produces a stream 8-bit number that is unpredictable without knowledge of input key, output is key-stream and is combined one byte at a time with XOR.
